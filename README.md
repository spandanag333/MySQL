### Data Analysis and Querying Examples using MySQL and the Parks and Recreation Dataset.

* This repository contains SQL query examples using the Parks and Recreation dataset, originally sourced from @AlexTheAnalyst's Data Analyst Bootcamp playlist on YouTube. The dataset provides a practical foundation for learning and practicing SQL concepts. The goal is to demonstrate various data manipulation techniques, including joins, aggregations, string functions, case statements, etc.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of three tables:

* **employee_demographics:** Contains employee information like name, age, gender, and birth date.
* **employee_salary:** Includes employee salary, occupation, and department ID.
* **parks_departments:** Lists different departments within the parks and recreation organization.

### Additional Notes

* The dataset is educational and might not reflect real-world data complexities.
* Consider exploring additional datasets and tools for more advanced SQL concepts and real-world applications.
